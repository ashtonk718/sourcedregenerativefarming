  <h1>What is Regenerative Farming?</h1>
 
  <p>  Regenerative (Regen) Agriculture is a farming and grazing method that aims to restore the land’s health and productivity. It is a holistic approach that focuses on soil health, biodiversity, and water, typically by practicing ranching techniques in harmony with nature. Regenerative agriculture is more than just sustainable; it focuses on reversing soil degradation and building it up to make it healthier than its current state. </p>

  
  <h2>What are the Benefits?</h2>

  <p>Regenerative farming offers numerous benefits for both the environment and farmers. By improving soil health, it enhances water retention, reduces erosion, and increases the land’s resilience to extreme weather conditions. The practice also promotes biodiversity, supporting healthier ecosystems for plants, animals, and beneficial microbes. Additionally, regenerative farming can lead to higher-quality crops, reduced reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and increased carbon sequestration, helping to combat climate change. Farmers often experience improved yields and long-term cost savings due to healthier, more productive land.</p>
